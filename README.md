# Mixed Messages -- Sports Edition

This is a short Javascript program for producing mixed messages that you might hear from sports commentators.

The sports referenced are (in the order presented in each array):
* Basketball
* Ice Hockey
* American Football
* Baseball
* Soccer (Football)

The mixed message generator will produce a message that will mix some messages from some of these different sports, and hopefully be a little bit funnyðŸ˜€

Please note that you need to run this from the command line and you should have Node installed, which can be downloaded here: https://nodejs.org/en/

Once in your command line, please type "node main.js" to run the program.
